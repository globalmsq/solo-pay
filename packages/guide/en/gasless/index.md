# Gasless Payments

Users can pay with just a signature, without gas fees.

## Overview

Gasless payments use the **ERC-2771 meta-transaction** standard. Users can pay with ERC-20 tokens without needing native tokens (MATIC, ETH, etc.).

::: tip Use Cases

- New user onboarding (first payment without gas)
- Better UX (complete payment with just a signature)
- Eliminate gas fee volatility

```

## Components

### 1. EIP-712 Signature

A typed signature generated by the user's wallet.

- Domain, types, and message are clearly displayed
- User can verify signature contents
- Replay attack prevention

### 2. ERC2771 Forwarder

OpenZeppelin's `ERC2771Forwarder` contract.

- Signature verification
- Original sender (`_msgSender()`) recovery
- Forwards calls to PaymentGateway

### 3. Relayer

Converts signed requests into on-chain transactions.

- Signature verification
- Gas fee payment
- Transaction submission and monitoring

## Relay Status Flow

```
submitted ────▶ pending ────▶ mined ────▶ confirmed
                   │
                   ▼
                failed
```

| Status      | Description                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `submitted` | Relay request submitted       |
| `pending`   | Transaction pending           |
| `mined`     | Transaction included in block |
| `confirmed` | Block confirmation complete   |
| `failed`    | Transaction failed            |

## Limitations

- Token must be pre-approved
- Depends on Relayer service availability
- Only supported on certain chains

## Supported Chains

| Chain        | Forwarder Address | Supported |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------- |
| Polygon      | `0x...`           | ✓         |
| Polygon Amoy | `0x...`           | ✓         |
